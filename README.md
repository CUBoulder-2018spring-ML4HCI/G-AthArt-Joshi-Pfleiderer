## Goal
To help Yoga Users keep a straight back when performing the Sukhasana pose. This pose requires sitting down, crossing one's legs and keeping one's back straight. 

## Tools

[Microsoft Kinect](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/kinect)

## Problem-solving approach
Using the Microsoft Kinect and Audio Outputs we aim to provide people aiming to better their Sukhasana pose. Based on what physical yoga position your back is at diffrent audio sounds will output providing you feedback in a non-intrusive way. Diffrent sounds will play for whether or not your back is straight or slanted, giving you feedback to improve your pose.

### Sensors
We use the Microsoft Kinect to track our bodies and more specificly our backs to check if they are straight or not.

### Feature extractor approach


### ML model structure
